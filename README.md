My name is Marius and I'm a Software Engineer working for [Goodgame Studios](www.goodgamestudios.com).

I live in Hamburg, Germany.

Most of the code that I came across during my time as developer, seemed complicated, hard to understand and very expensive to change to me.

That's why I spend a lot of time ranting about the code while I make it simple, expressive and easy to change.

I'm a [Domain-driven Design](http://dddcommunity.org/) enthusiast and like to learn and teach.
